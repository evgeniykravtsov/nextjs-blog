In this article, we will explore some lesser-known features of CSS that you may not have come across in your web development journey. These features can help you take your stylesheets to the next level and add more flexibility and power to your web designs. Some of the features we will cover include CSS variables, custom properties, grid layouts, and others. We will also discuss some of the browser support and potential pitfalls to be aware of when using these features. Whether you’re a seasoned web developer or just starting out, we hope you’ll find something new and useful in this article.

## Css variables
CSS variables, also known as custom properties, are values that can be stored in a stylesheet and reused throughout the document. They are defined using the -- prefix and are set using the var() function.

Here is an example of how to use CSS variables:

```
:root {
  --main-color: blue;
  --secondary-color: green;
}

body {
  color: var(--main-color);
}

h1 {
  color: var(--secondary-color);
}
```

In this example, the :root pseudo-class is used to define the CSS variables --main-color and --secondary-color with the values of blue and green, respectively. These variables can then be used throughout the stylesheet by calling the var() function with the variable name as the argument.

In this case, the body element will have a color of blue and the h1 element will have a color of green.

CSS variables can be helpful for reducing repetition in stylesheets and making it easier to update values globally. They can also be useful for creating themes or allowing users to customize certain aspects of a website.

## properties to grid layouts
In a grid layout, you can specify various properties such as the number of rows and columns, the size of the rows and columns, and the position of items within the grid. Some common properties that can be applied to grid layouts include:

grid-template-rows: Specifies the number of rows in the grid and the size of each row.
grid-template-columns: Specifies the number of columns in the grid and the size of each column.
grid-template-areas: Specifies the names of the areas in the grid.
grid-row-gap: Specifies the size of the gap between rows in the grid.
grid-column-gap: Specifies the size of the gap between columns in the grid.
grid-gap: A shorthand property for setting both the row gap and column gap at the same time.
Here is an example of a grid layout with three rows and three columns, using the grid-template-rows, grid-template-columns, and grid-template-areas properties:

```
.grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-rows: 50px 50px 50px;
  grid-template-columns: 50px 50px 50px;
  grid-template-areas: 
    "header header header"
    "sidebar content content"
    "footer footer footer";
}

.header {
  grid-area: header;
}

.sidebar {
  grid-area: sidebar;
}

.content {
  grid-area: content;
}

.footer {
  grid-area: footer;
}
```

This would create a grid with three rows, each 50 pixels tall, and three columns, each 50 pixels wide. The header, sidebar, content, and footer elements would be placed within the grid according to the specified grid areas.

## Css feature queries
Feature queries, also known as “CSS @supports” rules, allow you to apply styles conditionally based on whether a browser supports a particular CSS feature. They can be used to apply styles that use newer CSS features in modern browsers, while providing fallbacks for older browsers that do not support those features.

Here is an example of a feature query that checks if the browser supports the display: grid property:

```
@supports (display: grid) {
  /* Styles for browsers that support grid layout */
  .grid {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-rows: 50px 50px 50px;
    grid-template-columns: 50px 50px 50px;
  }
}

/* Styles for browsers that do not support grid layout */
.grid {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}
```

In this example, the display: grid property and related grid layout styles will only be applied in browsers that support grid layout. In browsers that do not support grid layout, the display: flex and flex-direction: column styles will be applied instead.

You can also use feature queries to test for specific values of a property. For example, the following feature query checks if the display property supports the grid value:

```
@supports (display: grid) {
  /* Styles for browsers that support grid layout */
  .grid {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-rows: 50px 50px 50px;
    grid-template-columns: 50px 50px 50px;
  }
}
```

You can also use the not keyword to negate the test, like this:

```
@supports not (display: grid) {
  /* Styles for browsers that do not support grid layout */
  .grid {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
  }
}
```

## Conclusion
In conclusion, there are many powerful and useful features in CSS that you may not have heard of before. From CSS variables and custom properties to grid layouts and feature queries, these features can help you create more flexible and dynamic stylesheets. While some of these features have limited browser support and may not be suitable for all projects, they are definitely worth exploring and considering as you develop your web designs. We hope that this article has introduced you to some new CSS features and inspired you to try them out in your own projects.
